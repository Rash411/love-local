Subject :This code defines a function short_pal that takes a string s as input and returns the shortest palindrome that can be obtained by appending characters to the beginning of the string. 

Logic:

Create a reversed version of the input string s and store it in the variable rev_s.

Iterate over possible substrings of the reversed string (rev_s).
For each iteration, check if the original string (s) starts with the current substring of the reversed string.
Construct Shortest Palindrome:

If a matching substring is found, construct the shortest palindrome by concatenating the remaining part of the reversed string (rev_s[:i]) with the original string (s).

Return the constructed shortest palindrome.

Algorithm:


Accept a string s as input.

Reverse the input string s and store it in the variable rev_s.

Use a loop to iterate over possible substrings of the reversed string (rev_s).
The loop variable i represents the starting index of the reversed substring.

For each iteration, check if the original string (s) starts with the current substring of the reversed string (rev_s[i:]).

If a match is found, construct the shortest palindrome by concatenating the remaining part of the reversed string (rev_s[:i]) with the original string (s).

Return the constructed shortest palindrome.
The algorithm efficiently identifies and constructs the shortest palindrome by examining reversed substrings of the input string.
